# My Solutions to Jane Street Monthly Problems
Welcome to my repository of solutions to the Jane Street Monthly Puzzles! I've always enjoyed tackling these brain-teasers, as they’re a great way to test my problem-solving skills, dive into interesting mathematical concepts, and get creative with algorithms and code.

Each puzzle is a new challenge, and I’ve written up my solutions to the best of my ability, breaking down the problem and showing the steps I took to find a solution. I often get into the math behind the puzzle, explore different approaches, and try to optimize where possible. Some problems were especially tricky, and I’ve shared any interesting insights I gained while working through them.

Each folder contains a solution to a monthly puzzle. While my solutions may not always be the most optimal, as the saying goes, "if it works, don't fix it!"
