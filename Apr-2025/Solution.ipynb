    "## April 2025 Puzzle\n",
    "\n",
    "This month's puzzle is a simple one.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are tasked with finding the value of $p$ such that the probability of there existing an infinite path down an infinite complete binary tree with node values summing to at most 1 is exactly $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: The All-Zero Path\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by considering only the all-zero path. Let $x$ be the probability that there exists an infinite path of all zeros starting from an arbitrary node.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two possible cases:\n",
    "1. The arbitrary node has value 0 (probability $p$),\n",
    "2. The node has value 1 â€” in which case no all-zero path can start here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now consider the children. For an infinite all-zero path to exist, we need:\n",
    "- The current node to be 0,\n",
    "- At least one of its children to be the root of an infinite all-zero path.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability that **neither** child continues an all-zero path is:\n",
    "\n",
    "**(1)**\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P_{\\text{fail}} = (1 - x)^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the probability that **at least one child** continues the path is:\n",
    "\n",
    "**(2)**\n",
    "$$\n",
    "1 - (1 - x)^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining this with the requirement that the current node is 0, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "**(3)**\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x = p \\cdot \\left(1 - (1 - x)^2\\right)\n",

    "### Step 2: Allowing One Node With Value 1\n",
    "\n",
    "We now expand the model to allow one node in the path to have value 1 (total sum at most 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $f(p)$ be the probability that there exists an infinite path with at most one node of value 1. Consider two cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Case 1: The root has value 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Then no further 1s are allowed. The remaining path must be all zeros. This occurs with probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "**(4)**\n",
    "$$\n",
    "(1 - p) \\cdot \\left(1 - (1 - x)^2\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Case 2: The root has value 0\n",
    "\n",
    "Then a future node may be 1, and the rest must be zeros. Recursively, this occurs with probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "**(5)**\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p \\cdot \\left(1 - (1 - f(p))^2\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, we obtain the recursion:\n",
    "\n",
    "**(6)**\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(p) = (1 - p) \\cdot \\left(1 - (1 - x)^2\\right) + p \\cdot \\left(1 - (1 - f(p))^2\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "From equation (3), solving for $x$, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "**(7)**\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x = \\frac{2p - 1}{p}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Substituting equation (7) into equation (6) and solving for the condition $f(p) = \\frac{1}{2}$, we arrive at the cubic:\n",
    "\n",
    "**(8)**\n",
    "$$\n",
    "3p^3 - 10p^2 + 12p - 4 = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving this cubic numerically (see code cell below), we find:\n",
    "\n",
    "**(9)**\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p \\approx 0.5306035754\n",
